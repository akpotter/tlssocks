Example docker-compose project in docker/localtest - should help to understand the configuration

```bash
# run example project
make docker-local-test
```

```bash
# try it

## tlssocksproxy

Opens an tls encrypted connection to tlssocks - optionally through one or multiple tcpproxies and makes it available as a "normal" socks5 server.

## tcpproxy

Very light weight wrapper around googles [https://github.com/google/tcpproxy](https://github.com/google/tcpproxy) - can be daisychained.

## tlssocks

Based on [github.com/armon/go-socks5](github.com/armon/go-socks5) wrapped by [https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/).

- tls protection
- authentication with bcrypt hashed passwords (htpasswd compatible)
- destinations configuration

Managing credentials:

Can be done with good old htpasswd - in case of doubt `man htpasswd`

```bash
# set the password for a user in an existing file using bcrypt
htpasswd -B path/to/users.htpasswd <user-name>
```

Configuring destinations:

By default every proxy request is denied, except it is explicitly allowed through the destinations configuration. 

Destinations are configured on a name basis and allowed for ports and users.

WARNING - if you are running multiple vhosts on one destination all of them are accessible, since tlssocks is not inspecting the incoming traffic.

```yaml
---
# destination www.heise.de will be accessible trough ports 80, 443 for users jan and peter
www.heise.de:
  ports: 
    - 80
    - 443
  users:
    - jan
    - peter
# destination echo is acce
echo:
  ports: 
    - 8080
  users:
    - jan

www.google.com:
  ports: 
    - 443
  users:
    - peter
...
```

## caveats / todos

- only name based destinations are supported

## security concerns

All vhosts on a destination can be accessed through the allowed ports - there is no traffic inspection to prevent this.
